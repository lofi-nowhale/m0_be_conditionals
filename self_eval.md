# Self Evaluation

1. **When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?** Conditionals are useful for whenever you are wanting to compare things or run an action or print a statement depending on a variables value! 
1. **If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?** Start from the basics, I got a little too in my head and needed to back up so that I didn't go down a rabbit hole of googling or kind of spiralling into solutions that just aren't reasonable. 
1. **What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?** I was most satisfied by how natrually some of the else statements came especially with challenge 2 of just essentially "segmenting" out the audience for each message.
